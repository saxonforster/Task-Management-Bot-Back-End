"""
A Client is an object that represents a connection to Discord. A Client handles events, 
tracks state, and generally interacts with Discord APIs.

Here, youâ€™ve created a Client and implemented its on_ready() event handler, 
which handles the event when the Client has established a connection to Discord 
and it has finished preparing the data that Discord has sent, such as login state, 
guild and channel data, and more.

In other words, on_ready() will be called (and your message will be printed) 
once client is ready for further action.
