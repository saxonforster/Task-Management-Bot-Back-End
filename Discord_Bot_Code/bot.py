"""
A Client is an object that represents a connection to Discord. A Client handles events, 
tracks state, and generally interacts with Discord APIs.

Here, youâ€™ve created a Client and implemented its on_ready() event handler, 
which handles the event when the Client has established a connection to Discord 
and it has finished preparing the data that Discord has sent, such as login state, 
guild and channel data, and more.

In other words, on_ready() will be called (and your message will be printed) 
once client is ready for further action.

This code sets up a new Discord bot using the commands.Bot class and sets the command prefix to "!". It also creates a new cog called DueDate which handles the !due_date command.

The !due_date command takes two arguments: the task ID and an optional due date. If a due date is not provided, it sends a GET request to the Django view to get the due date for the task ID. If a due date is provided, it sends a POST request to the Django view to add the due date to the task ID.

Note that you will need to replace the http://127.0.0.1:8000 URL with the URL of your Django app.

To run the Discord bot, you'll need to replace your-bot-token with your actual bot token and run the discordbot.py file: python discordbot.py
